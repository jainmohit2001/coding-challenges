When
Lionel
Giles
began
his
translation
of
Sun
Tzŭ’s
Art
of
War
the
work
was
virtually
unknown
in
Europe
Its
introduction
to
Europe
began
in
when
a
French
Jesuit
Father
living
in
China
Joseph
Amiot
acquired
a
copy
of
it
and
translated
it
into
French
It
was
not
a
good
translation
because
according
to
Dr
Giles
I
t
contains
a
great
deal
that
Sun
Tzŭ
did
not
write
and
very
little
indeed
of
what
he
did
The
first
translation
into
English
was
published
in
in
Tokyo
by
Capt
E
F
Calthrop
R
F
A
However
this
translation
is
in
the
words
of
Dr
Giles
excessively
bad
He
goes
further
in
this
criticism
It
is
not
merely
a
question
of
downright
blunders
from
which
none
can
hope
to
be
wholly
exempt
Omissions
were
frequent
hard
passages
were
willfully
distorted
or
slurred
over
Such
offenses
are
less
pardonable
They
would
not
be
tolerated
in
any
edition
of
a
Latin
or
Greek
classic
and
a
similar
standard
of
honesty
ought
to
be
insisted
upon
in
translations
from
Chinese
In
a
new
edition
of
Capt
Calthrop’s
translation
was
published
in
London
It
was
an
improvement
on
the
first—omissions
filled
up
and
numerous
mistakes
corrected—but
new
errors
were
created
in
the
process
Dr
Giles
in
justifying
his
translation
wrote
It
was
not
undertaken
out
of
any
inflated
estimate
of
my
own
powers
but
I
could
not
help
feeling
that
Sun
Tzŭ
deserved
a
better
fate
than
had
befallen
him
and
I
knew
that
at
any
rate
I
could
hardly
fail
to
improve
on
the
work
of
my
predecessors
Clearly
Dr
Giles’
work
established
much
of
the
groundwork
for
the
work
of
later
translators
who
published
their
own
editions
Of
the
later
editions
of
the
Art
of
War
I
have
examined
two
feature
Giles’
edited
translation
and
notes
the
other
two
present
the
same
basic
information
from
the
ancient
Chinese
commentators
found
in
the
Giles
edition
Of
these
four
Giles’
edition
is
the
most
scholarly
and
presents
the
reader
an
incredible
amount
of
information
concerning
Sun
Tzŭ’s
text
much
more
than
any
other
translation
The
Giles’
edition
of
the
Art
of
War
as
stated
above
was
a
scholarly
work
Dr
Giles
was
a
leading
sinologue
at
the
time
and
an
assistant
in
the
Department
of
Oriental
Printed
Books
and
Manuscripts
in
the
British
Museum
Apparently
he
wanted
to
produce
a
definitive
edition
superior
to
anything
else
that
existed
and
perhaps
something
that
would
become
a
standard
translation
It
was
the
best
translation
available
for
years
But
apparently
there
was
not
much
interest
in
Sun
Tzŭ
in
English
speaking
countries
since
it
took
the
start
of
the
Second
World
War
to
renew
interest
in
his
work
Several
people
published
unsatisfactory
English
translations
of
Sun
Tzŭ
In
Dr
Giles’
translation
was
edited
and
published
in
the
United
States
in
a
series
of
military
science
books
But
it
wasn’t
until
that
a
good
English
translation
by
Samuel
B
Griffith
and
still
in
print
was
published
that
was
an
equal
to
Giles’
translation
While
this
translation
is
more
lucid
than
Dr
Giles’
translation
it
lacks
his
copious
notes
that
make
his
so
interesting
Dr
Giles
produced
a
work
primarily
intended
for
scholars
of
the
Chinese
civilization
and
language
It
contains
the
Chinese
text
of
Sun
Tzŭ
the
English
translation
and
voluminous
notes
along
with
numerous
footnotes
Unfortunately
some
of
his
notes
and
footnotes
contain
Chinese
characters
some
are
completely
Chinese
Thus
a
conversion
to
a
Latin
alphabet
etext
was
difficult
I
did
the
conversion
in
complete
ignorance
of
Chinese
except
for
what
I
learned
while
doing
the
conversion
Thus
I
faced
the
difficult
task
of
paraphrasing
it
while
retaining
as
much
of
the
important
text
as
I
could
Every
paraphrase
represents
a
loss
thus
I
did
what
I
could
to
retain
as
much
of
the
text
as
possible
Because
the
text
contains
a
Chinese
concordance
I
was
able
to
transliterate
proper
names
books
and
the
like
at
the
risk
of
making
the
text
more
obscure
However
the
text
on
the
whole
is
quite
satisfactory
for
the
casual
reader
a
transformation
made
possible
by
conversion
to
an
etext
However
I
come
away
from
this
task
with
the
feeling
of
loss
