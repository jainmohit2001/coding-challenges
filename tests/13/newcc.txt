Helping you become a better software engineer through coding challenges that build real applications.
I share a weekly coding challenge aimed at helping software engineers level up their skills through deliberate practice.
These are challenges that Iâ€™ve used or am using as exercises to learn a new programming language or technology.
Each challenge will have you writing a full application or tool. Most of which will be based on real world tools and utilities.
